class SkeletonDefinition:
    """
    The SkeletonDefinition class serves as a blueprint for defining the shape ("skeleton") of an animal.

    It encapsulates the concept of markers, which are moving points of reference on the animal, and body sections, 
    which group these markers into meaningful anatomical parts. Fixed markers are those that do not move during 
    animation but might help with visualisation. 

    Attributes:
    - marker_names (list): A list of all marker names that represent key points on the skeleton.
    - fixed_marker_names (list): A list of marker names that are fixed and do not change position.
    - body_sections (dict): A dictionary that maps body section names to their corresponding marker names.

    Methods:
    - get_marker_indices(marker_subset, csv_marker_names): Retrieves the indices of specified markers from a 
      given list of marker names.
    - get_body_section_indices(csv_marker_names): Returns a mapping of body sections to their respective 
      marker indices, ensuring that all markers are accounted for.

    This class is designed to be extended by specific animal skeleton definitions, allowing for tailored 
    implementations while maintaining a consistent interface.
